# Hello, I'm Stanley:
I'm from the small town of New Bern, the birthplace of Pepsi, located on the east coast of North Carolina. After graduating, I hopped straight into learning web development because I‚Äôve always wanted to create software as a service. Plus, most software engineering roles seem to prioritize full-stack experience. I started by learning the basics of React.js through beginner tutorials on YouTube. More recently, I‚Äôve developed a passion for big data and am considering pursuing a Master‚Äôs in AI or Data Science in Fall 2025. To gain practical experience, I‚Äôve started working on data-related projects, focusing on data processing and analysis. I‚Äôve been hands on with tools like dbt, PostgreSQL, Power BI, AWS Lake Formation, AWS Glue, and Snowflake. I find collecting and analyzing big data fascinating because it uncovers valuable business insights and creates opportunities to use AI and machine learning for building and training predictive models. When it comes to a company, I value more than just the name. I‚Äôm looking for opportunities to grow and learn professionally and personally. I‚Äôd be thrilled to be a part of any company that offers a chance to contribute meaningfully through coding, testing, and developing innovative solutions while expanding my skills and tackling new challenges.
