# Hello, I'm Stanley:
Recent Computer Science graduate from Rutgers, driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. Currently developing an app that pulls data from various online sources to provide more accurate and consistent cafe ratings, reducing the ambiguity often found across different platforms like Google Maps, Yelp, Trip Advisor, and Apple Maps. As a coffee enthusiast, I‚Äôm excited to combine my passion for tech and coffee in a project that improves the cafe search experience.
